# 1. What is the difference between the internet and and intranet?

# 2. Because big companies have their own intranets, how were they able to give back large blocks of
reserved IPv4 addresses and stave off IPv4 address exhaustion?

# 3. What are the private IP network blocks?

# 4. What is a walled garden?

# 5. Why is it a good idea to use secure channels like TLS even with applications that communicate inside of a walled garden?

# 6. What is a DMZ?

# 7. What is a bastion host?

# 8. Where is the firewall in relation to the internet, intranet, walled gardens, and DMZ?

# 9. Why do we need isolated networks? (Why are we using the Pi's on an isolated network?)

# 10. What is the function of a firewall?

# 11. What is the difference between NAT, SOCKS, and application proxies?

## 11.1 Is there a reason to have all three? Or are there use cases for each technology?

# 12. Why do we need VPNs?

# 13. How do the IP addresses you are using change when using a VPN?

# 14. Why would you want to use a VPN if you are connected to the internet? (at SBUX for example) and you are connecting to another internet service (like Netflix, for example)?

# 15. What is the advantage of connecting remote offices together over VPNs rather than dedicated lines?
